		  <i><b>Paperstone</b></i> is the name of the first ever R package I created, which allows users to play a game of Scissors-Paper-Stone against R. My blog is named after it as a tribute to how this quintessential game is often used as an intro assignment to students in any Programming 101 class.<br><br>
		  This blog documents my hobby coding + data analytics projects, mainly focusing on using data science to better understand social and spatial issues. I'm particularly interested in <br>spatial data science, database structures and text mining</b>. I'm currently a student in Quantitative Methods, and I hope to share my learnings and love for data science (esp. for social good!) through this blog.<br><br>
