		  This blog documents my <b>hobby coding + data analytics</b> projects, mainly focusing on using data science to better understand social and spatial issues. I'm particularly interested in spatial data science, database structures and text mining. I'm currently a student in Quantitative Methods, and I hope to share my learnings and love for data science (esp. for social good!) through this blog.<br><br>
